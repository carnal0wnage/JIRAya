This is a fork of https://github.com/anmolksachan/JIRAya

This vulnerability checks weren't really working correctly and didnt do much in the way of validating or dumping some data if the URL was a 200. 

### Fixed
* add the ability to specify jira path
* add some fixes to support http/https better
* handle unverified SSL certs

## Install

`pip install -r requirements`

`python3 JIRAya.py --single 1.2.3.4 -p /jira/` (jira path added)

`python3 JIRAya.py --single 5.6.7.8`
